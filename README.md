# Single-Phase-Energy-Measurement-Development-Board
The Smart Samaan’s Single-Phase Energy Measurement Development Board is a powerful and versatile solution for accurate energy monitoring in residential, commercial, and industrial settings. The board includes HLW8012 8-pin metering IC that communicates with the STM8S103F3 to transfer the measured data to the microcontroller.The key features of this board are:
•	STM8S103F3 8-bit controller with 8K Flash, 1K RAM, and 640 Bytes EEPROM having 16MHz advanced processor core.
•	Precisely measures energy consumption, instantaneous power, I RMS, and V RMS.
•	Dedicated UART pins for communication with the PC via USB serial port.
•	I2C port for serial interfacing of OLED displays (e.g., 0.96" or 1.3" OLED display or similar such as I2C-based character LCDs)
•	Additional I/O pins for ADC and other purposes
